A repo where I will store new information and examples of things that I am learning

My educational background is in electronics and computer systems engineering. While completing that degree I was introduced to programming, and the method I used to write my code was trial and error because, at the time, the quality of the code did
not really matter for my assignments. As long as it worked it was good enough. However, as I have entered the professional world this just won't do anymore. In this time I have learnt about the importance of planning, readability and reusability of code.
I have enjoyed learning about the coding realm and am always wanting to improve more. There is so much to learn, and new technology is always coming out. I want to use this repo as a way to ensure I know the fundamentals as well as a way to
keep up with the latest and greatest things coming out.
