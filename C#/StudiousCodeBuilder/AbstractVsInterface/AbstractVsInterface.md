# Abstract vs Interface
What are abstract and interface keywords? What do they mean? What do they do? When should you use them?

## [Abstract](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/abstract)
When the abstract keyword is used for a class or a class member it is used to indicate that the item is incomplete. They are useful to give structure to classes that
are similar (have similar method names or properties) but have different functionality in how the methods should function. It should be noted that the abstract classes
themselves cannot be instantiated, they are there to be inherited by other classes.
